I read and understood what exactly makes a project open source and why it is important to adhere to these 
10 guidlines when working on an open source project.

Two rules i generally follow when answering questions are:
  1. Do not overcomplicate an answer by throwing in unnecessary terminology and useless facts. It is more helpful to explain
  all things the simplest way possible.
  2. When answering a question word it in the way that made you understand the topic best when you first learned.
