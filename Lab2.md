2.  It is very important to choose a license when working on any ope source project. The type of license you choose determines how your code can be used and who can use your code. It also determines how easily your open source code can be taken an commercialized.

3. They shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because open source software is not necessarily free software. When software doesn't have a license, under US law, it is considered to be a copyright of the author and cannot be used without the author's written consent. Especially in the case of commecializing open source software without a license.

4. I do agree with this claim. Crowdsourcing code helps to take strain off of the small group of developers and speeds along the production of any useful software and helps catch bugs more quickly. Like the saying going many hands make light work.

5. The use of the GPLv2 License for Linux is completely justified. Being widely know as an open source operating system, Linux having a GPL means that any additions or improvements made to the Linux OS are made available to the entire Linux community. The Linux community is very large and active, so if there were a highly restrictive license on the software collaboration would not be nearly as feasible.
