Coding style, in my opinion, is a very important aspect of software development. Following an organized coding style will allow one's code to be more easily read and understood by users and other developers. Utilizing well known code architectures as opposed to "just winging it" is one of the most beneficial habits as a software developer. Commenting is not only important when it come to open source software, but even for large projects to help yourself in keeping track of your code and what each function does. It walso helps to keep track of your train of thought when going back to debug and test code. Using proper variable names is also helpful and should be a major part of practicing good coding style. Randomly named variable can be confusing and lead to errors due to careless mistakes. All in all i agree that coding style comes down to personal prefernce in the long run, I just feel that good coding practices should be a part of every software developer's own style.
